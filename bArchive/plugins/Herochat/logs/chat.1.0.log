2016.08.04 16:22:22 Super Dragon Sp0t_: cute gazebo
2016.08.04 16:22:33 PSI Kid ~Whirlpool: ty pal
2016.08.04 16:23:43 Super Dragon Sp0t_: im crunk
2016.08.04 16:24:12 Super Dragon Sp0t_: you should make the distilled sake apply blindness too
2016.08.04 16:24:31 Super Dragon Sp0t_: it did it for like half a second
2016.08.04 16:24:48 Grand Master Big_Chungy: you should try doing drunk parkour onto the moose headw
2016.08.04 16:25:10 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i have the sake
2016.08.04 16:25:54 Grand Master Big_Chungy: you know what's bullshit
2016.08.04 16:26:00 Super Dragon Sp0t_: the moon landing
2016.08.04 16:26:07 Grand Master Big_Chungy: the sinnoh league semifinal battle
2016.08.04 16:26:17 Grand Master Big_Chungy: tobias and his fucking darkrai and latios
2016.08.04 16:26:42 Grand Master Big_Chungy: ash should have won even against those pokemon
2016.08.04 16:26:54 Grand Master Big_Chungy: because darkrai took a direct hit from megahorn which would destroy it
2016.08.04 16:27:21 Grand Master Big_Chungy: there is no combination of stat distribution that allows darkrai to survive megahorn from heracross
2016.08.04 16:27:33 Super Dragon Sp0t_: well
2016.08.04 16:27:52 Super Dragon Sp0t_: you have to consider that in the anime it's completely possible that heracross was way underleveled
2016.08.04 16:28:01 Grand Master Big_Chungy: heracross is one of ash's strongest pokemon
2016.08.04 16:28:15 Grand Master Big_Chungy: it took like six fire blasts from a really strong magmar
2016.08.04 16:28:18 Super Dragon Sp0t_: was it his heracross from the beginning of jhoto journeys?
2016.08.04 16:28:22 Grand Master Big_Chungy: yea
2016.08.04 16:28:24 Super Dragon Sp0t_: oh damn
2016.08.04 16:28:28 Super Dragon Sp0t_: well that is some bullshit then
2016.08.04 16:28:50 Grand Master Big_Chungy: that was the opening of the battle
2016.08.04 16:28:58 Grand Master Big_Chungy: then darkrai ko'd two more pokemon before it went down
2016.08.04 16:29:03 Grand Master Big_Chungy: so it really would have changed the match
2016.08.04 16:29:21 Grand Master Big_Chungy: it also would have helped if ash didn't use a fucking torkoal and a gible
2016.08.04 16:29:46 Grand Master Big_Chungy: he's gonna win kalos league
2016.08.04 16:29:47 Grand Master Big_Chungy: he has to
2016.08.04 16:29:50 Grand Master Big_Chungy: he has a real team
2016.08.04 16:29:56 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.04 16:30:03 Super Dragon Sp0t_: never underestimate ash's ability to fuck up
2016.08.04 16:30:24 Grand Master Big_Chungy: he has his special greninja transformation
2016.08.04 16:30:29 Grand Master Big_Chungy: and some really solid mega evolution candidates
2016.08.04 16:30:32 Grand Master Big_Chungy: including heracros
2016.08.04 16:30:52 Super Dragon Sp0t_: does his heracross know rock blast/pin missile
2016.08.04 16:31:00 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: how long should the blindness last on the sake
2016.08.04 16:31:04 Super Dragon Sp0t_: uhhh
2016.08.04 16:31:05 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i don't know
2016.08.04 16:31:06 Super Dragon Sp0t_: 10 secs
2016.08.04 16:31:13 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: damn that's strong stuff
2016.08.04 16:31:13 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i've seen it use horn attack, megahorn, and sleep talk
2016.08.04 16:31:26 Super Dragon Sp0t_: hmm
2016.08.04 16:31:30 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: sleep talk?
2016.08.04 16:31:31 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that's a thing?
2016.08.04 16:31:38 Grand Master Big_Chungy: yea

2016.08.04 19:21:42 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: so the basic command block adds 1 to the boss HP stat
2016.08.04 19:21:50 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: for the fake player 'GigaBowser'
2016.08.04 19:21:54 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: it's set to chain though
2016.08.04 19:21:57 Goddess of Light ~Marty: nice
2016.08.04 19:22:01 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: to automatically set the sidebar display to Boss HP
2016.08.04 19:22:09 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: so that if it's not already there it'll show up
2016.08.04 19:22:27 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and then there's a reset command block that'll reset gigabowser's hp to nonexistent
2016.08.04 19:22:42 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and since there's no more players with a score in that objective
2016.08.04 19:22:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: the sidebar goes away
2016.08.04 19:23:17 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oops

2016.08.04 21:28:35 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: it could have
2016.08.04 21:28:40 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: not cleared the temp files it downloaded
2016.08.04 21:28:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and just have been grabbing those
2016.08.04 21:28:55 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: not entirely likely but it's worth a shot

2016.08.05 11:21:48 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: y'know what makes building a futuristic city hard in minecraft?
2016.08.05 11:22:00 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Spheres?
2016.08.05 11:22:03 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: the lack of metal stairs, slabs, etc.
2016.08.05 11:22:06 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: ah
2016.08.05 11:22:08 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: all the things normally used for furniture
2016.08.05 11:22:15 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: their metal forms
2016.08.05 11:22:17 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: are nonexistant
2016.08.05 11:22:36 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: in addition, ther'es like no decorative metal blocks
2016.08.05 11:31:30 Hylian Knight ~Icy: What did you expect when the only metal in the game is iron and gold
2016.08.05 11:31:36 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: not much else
2016.08.05 11:31:39 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: but still
2016.08.05 11:31:43 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: it frustrates me
2016.08.05 11:31:47 Hylian Knight ~Icy: same
2016.08.05 11:31:53 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: not to mention minecraft's utter lack of shaped blocks
2016.08.05 11:32:07 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: makes any kind of design work much more difficult
2016.08.05 11:32:13 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: you'd think they'd have slopes at least
2016.08.05 11:32:24 Hylian Knight ~Icy: I was saying there should at least be slabs of evert block
2016.08.05 11:32:29 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 11:32:40 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: .@Mojang: Diagonals do not ruin your aesthetic
2016.08.05 11:33:20 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh
2016.08.05 11:33:22 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that's not good
2016.08.05 11:33:42 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: also you should probably invest in a backup power supply for your comp if that's a problem
2016.08.05 11:33:49 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: ah
2016.08.05 11:35:19 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: rip
2016.08.05 11:35:32 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that's what, 2 and a half hours for you?
2016.08.05 11:35:35 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: hour and a hafl?
2016.08.05 11:36:30 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: 1 and a half
2016.08.05 11:36:35 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: welp
2016.08.05 11:36:57 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: rip
2016.08.05 11:47:17 Grand Master Big_Chungy: guh
2016.08.05 11:47:24 Grand Master Big_Chungy: it's so hard to find a good spot for an entire city
2016.08.05 11:47:32 Grand Master Big_Chungy: there's no really flat natural land
2016.08.05 11:47:55 Grand Master Big_Chungy: im just gonna level this entire forest
2016.08.05 11:48:13 Grand Master Big_Chungy: team royal needs lumber to build with anyway
2016.08.05 11:49:07 Grand Master Big_Chungy: async is doing its async thing
2016.08.05 11:49:46 Star Warrior Protocut: Won't you hold me tight, dive into the night
2016.08.05 11:49:56 Grand Master Big_Chungy: these leaves are fucking owned
2016.08.05 11:50:13 Star Warrior Protocut: Alright I like where this city is going
2016.08.05 11:50:42 Star Warrior Protocut: Now this is what I call deforestation
2016.08.05 11:52:36 Grand Master Big_Chungy: 242081 leaves lost their lives today
2016.08.05 11:52:59 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: a a a a a a
2016.08.05 11:53:21 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: wow
2016.08.05 11:53:42 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and yeah just terraforming so you can build is a good idea
2016.08.05 11:53:44 Star Warrior Protocut: Purification in progress
2016.08.05 11:54:01 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I flattened a bunch of desert to start team revolution
2016.08.05 11:54:19 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: it's only 4AM for you
2016.08.05 11:54:28 Grand Master Big_Chungy: he's in the future
2016.08.05 11:54:29 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i think
2016.08.05 11:54:34 Grand Master Big_Chungy: is it 4 AM on the fifth or the sixth
2016.08.05 11:54:43 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: he should be moved to team revolution immediately
2016.08.05 11:55:07 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: also correct me if I'm in the wrong here but what if
2016.08.05 11:55:09 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: what if
2016.08.05 11:55:19 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: to simulate space we just built in a very large cube walled by end portals
2016.08.05 11:55:24 Star Warrior Protocut: dude way if we pees form butts
2016.08.05 11:55:31 Star Warrior Protocut: Or
2016.08.05 11:55:33 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i don't think they have sides
2016.08.05 11:55:36 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: they dont'
2016.08.05 11:55:37 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: fuck
2016.08.05 11:55:37 Star Warrior Protocut: We could just build in the end
2016.08.05 11:55:46 Grand Master Big_Chungy: building in the end would work
2016.08.05 11:55:49 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 11:56:01 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: place a warp-pad down here and just build in the end
2016.08.05 11:56:13 Grand Master Big_Chungy: build far away though
2016.08.05 11:56:15 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 11:56:27 Star Warrior Protocut: That way our city is cooler since it's in an entirely different dimension
2016.08.05 11:56:29 Grand Master Big_Chungy: because i want to make sure our server is survival ready after crackle beat the entire game
2016.08.05 11:56:31 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh hey in that case we CAN make a giant floating city end portal
2016.08.05 11:56:36 Grand Master Big_Chungy: so that includes respawning the dragon
2016.08.05 11:56:43 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: will it aggro tho
2016.08.05 11:56:57 Grand Master Big_Chungy: no but everything that it flies through except end stone and obsidian is destroyed
2016.08.05 11:57:04 Grand Master Big_Chungy: that may be only with mobgriefing on but i'm not sure
2016.08.05 11:57:10 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I think it's with mobgriefing on
2016.08.05 11:57:16 Star Warrior Protocut: I think that's only mobgriefing
2016.08.05 11:57:33 Star Warrior Protocut: Because I remember summoning those bad boys and they didn't destroy anything
2016.08.05 11:57:42 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I will change this from the team revolution headquarters
2016.08.05 11:57:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: to the team revolution warp pad
2016.08.05 11:58:11 Grand Master Big_Chungy: on one hand i don't want to flatten this area because it's team medieval and they don't have
2016.08.05 11:58:12 Grand Master Big_Chungy: bulldozers
2016.08.05 11:58:15 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 11:58:25 Grand Master Big_Chungy: but on the other hand you can't build shit in minecraft on hills
2016.08.05 11:58:30 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 11:58:49 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh y'know what, we can turn this into a landing zone from space
2016.08.05 11:58:52 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: since we're building in the end
2016.08.05 11:59:53 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i sure hope async does its job well
2016.08.05 12:00:38 Grand Master Big_Chungy: nothing bug just a 4 million block selection
2016.08.05 12:00:41 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 12:01:00 Grand Master Big_Chungy: a lot of that was air and this seems to be handling it fine
2016.08.05 12:01:07 Grand Master Big_Chungy: the queue has a couple hundred thousand blocks but that's it
2016.08.05 12:01:45 Star Warrior Protocut: Hades has many allies
2016.08.05 12:01:59 Star Warrior Protocut: In fact, there's a couple of hundred of them just up ahead
2016.08.05 12:02:02 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: so tall obelisk-like warp pad or lower to the groundn
2016.08.05 12:02:17 Star Warrior Protocut: Hmmm
2016.08.05 12:02:22 Star Warrior Protocut: I lik obelisks
2016.08.05 12:02:25 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 12:02:29 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: they'll climb up a large staircase then
2016.08.05 12:02:37 Star Warrior Protocut: And it's a desert so it kind of fits
2016.08.05 12:02:39 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 12:02:43 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I falttened the area too
2016.08.05 12:02:46 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: would be a shame not to make use of it
2016.08.05 12:03:03 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: good thing we're practically smack dab in the middle of it
2016.08.05 12:05:24 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: endstone and purpur?
2016.08.05 12:05:36 Star Warrior Protocut: Probably
2016.08.05 12:05:40 Grand Master Big_Chungy: you can incorporate those yeah
2016.08.05 12:05:49 Grand Master Big_Chungy: it's especially good because of the end stone bricks they have now
2016.08.05 12:05:52 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 12:06:01 Grand Master Big_Chungy: but also future spacey people wouldn't use natural resources entirely
2016.08.05 12:06:06 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: right
2016.08.05 12:14:25 Star Warrior Protocut: Alright I think I found a pretty good spot in the end for our cityw
2016.08.05 12:14:32 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: alright
2016.08.05 12:15:20 Star Warrior Protocut: I set a warp "revolution"
2016.08.05 12:15:24 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: k
2016.08.05 12:21:35 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: should I make it so when they step into the beam
2016.08.05 12:21:37 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: they get warped
2016.08.05 12:21:39 Star Warrior Protocut: Yes
2016.08.05 12:21:41 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that was my intiial plan
2016.08.05 12:21:42 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: k

2016.08.05 12:22:21 Grand Master Big_Chungy: to start plannin royal
2016.08.05 12:22:35 Star Warrior Protocut: The great thing about the end is it's already mostly flat
2016.08.05 12:22:46 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: if we're building in the end we can freely make a floating city
2016.08.05 12:23:00 Grand Master Big_Chungy: yeah try to keep it away from the actual island
2016.08.05 12:23:07 Grand Master Big_Chungy: teleport out into the void so it can be space
2016.08.05 12:24:26 Star Warrior Protocut: And dirt
2016.08.05 12:24:45 Super Dragon Sp0t_: the end is up for grabs
2016.08.05 12:24:46 Star Warrior Protocut: See you in street fighter 5 folks
2016.08.05 12:24:55 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: ./warp
2016.08.05 12:24:57 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh
2016.08.05 12:24:58 Super Dragon Sp0t_: this looks like a good area jacob
2016.08.05 12:25:00 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that's why
2016.08.05 12:25:05 Super Dragon Sp0t_: uhh
2016.08.05 12:25:07 Super Dragon Sp0t_: one thing tho
2016.08.05 12:25:16 Super Dragon Sp0t_: i think this whole area should be elevated instead of depressed
2016.08.05 12:25:30 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: we can't do warp via command block
2016.08.05 12:25:31 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i was testing out making a big hill with voxelsniper
2016.08.05 12:25:33 Grand Master Big_Chungy: for castle
2016.08.05 12:25:37 Star Warrior Protocut: well
2016.08.05 12:25:43 Grand Master Big_Chungy: because castles are always built on hills as opportune defensive points
2016.08.05 12:25:45 Super Dragon Sp0t_: can i bring the flat space up a few blocks
2016.08.05 12:25:51 Star Warrior Protocut: Just put a sign in the middle of the beam
2016.08.05 12:25:53 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 12:25:58 Star Warrior Protocut: Also
2016.08.05 12:25:59 Grand Master Big_Chungy: yeah, it would also be easier to smooth it down that way
2016.08.05 12:26:05 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I mean I can
2016.08.05 12:26:08 Grand Master Big_Chungy: bring it up several blocks around the rest of the land
2016.08.05 12:26:09 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: no wait that wouldn't work
2016.08.05 12:26:16 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: nevermind, I'lll put a warp sign down
2016.08.05 12:26:28 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh you wanna chang ehtte beam colour
2016.08.05 12:26:49 Star Warrior Protocut: You think purple looks good?
2016.08.05 12:27:03 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: it's team revolution so it's gotta be Yellow
2016.08.05 12:27:07 Star Warrior Protocut: Right
2016.08.05 12:27:38 Super Dragon Sp0t_: hold onto your butts
2016.08.05 12:27:43 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: no
2016.08.05 12:27:48 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: i dont wanna
2016.08.05 12:27:50 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i did 4 million blocks earlier and it was fine
2016.08.05 12:28:12 Super Dragon Sp0t_: vox is actually p intuitive when it comes to the more basic tools
2016.08.05 12:28:20 Super Dragon Sp0t_: which are the only tools you use regularly
2016.08.05 12:28:32 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: does the warp work
2016.08.05 12:28:35 Star Warrior Protocut: Yes
2016.08.05 12:28:37 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: ok
2016.08.05 12:28:49 Grand Master Big_Chungy: then there's the weird ones
2016.08.05 12:28:57 Super Dragon Sp0t_: yea
2016.08.05 12:29:00 Star Warrior Protocut: I went to the place I was thinking we could use but yeah building in the void would be better
2016.08.05 12:29:02 Super Dragon Sp0t_: like the shell
2016.08.05 12:29:06 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: well
2016.08.05 12:29:09 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: we can make it attached to
2016.08.05 12:29:13 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: where you were thinking
2016.08.05 12:29:14 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: or we can build there
2016.08.05 12:29:19 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and have a detachment branch out over the void
2016.08.05 12:29:37 Star Warrior Protocut: If we do that then there's another island that would work a little better
2016.08.05 12:29:52 Grand Master Big_Chungy: do we want this to come up a little more
2016.08.05 12:30:14 Star Warrior Protocut: Actually there are a wide variety of islands
2016.08.05 12:30:18 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 12:32:12 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh you cleared the chorus fruit
2016.08.05 12:32:15 Star Warrior Protocut: Yeah
2016.08.05 12:32:17 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: So i was really bored last night at work and devised a massive
2016.08.05 12:32:23 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Pokemon style fighting tourny
2016.08.05 12:32:29 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: or league
2016.08.05 12:32:32 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: if you will
2016.08.05 12:32:33 Grand Master Big_Chungy: you made pokken tournament???

2016.08.05 12:33:14 Star Warrior Protocut: Hey jacob come check out this sick prank I pulled
2016.08.05 12:33:21 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Its essentially a tourny as a schedueled event with as many as possible
2016.08.05 12:33:27 Grand Master Big_Chungy: haha nice
2016.08.05 12:33:31 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Of a single combat tourny
2016.08.05 12:33:36 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Then the top like
2016.08.05 12:33:38 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: eh
2016.08.05 12:33:42 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: 13

2016.08.05 12:34:08 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: so on so forth
2016.08.05 12:34:23 Grand Master Big_Chungy: oh neat
2016.08.05 12:34:39 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: And then anyone could be able to challenge Leaders for their badge
2016.08.05 12:34:44 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: etc etc
2016.08.05 12:35:07 Grand Master Big_Chungy: and this way challenging gyms is like the anime
2016.08.05 12:35:14 Grand Master Big_Chungy: they're never fucking there to challenge
2016.08.05 12:35:20 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 12:35:24 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Well the gyms themselves would be designed by the leaders hopefully
2016.08.05 12:35:48 Super Dragon Sp0t_: is marty around
2016.08.05 12:35:52 Super Dragon Sp0t_: like, listening to console
2016.08.05 12:35:53 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Leaders would be able to make them as aesthetically and mechanically gimmicked
2016.08.05 12:35:55 Grand Master Big_Chungy: not yet
2016.08.05 12:35:59 Grand Master Big_Chungy: he went to bed p late
2016.08.05 12:36:07 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Either that or use like a regulation arena
2016.08.05 12:37:20 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: I still need to think of a way for new leaders to be implimented, how leaders could move up
2016.08.05 12:37:23 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I could make a parkour gym where they're constantly poisoned for super sudden death parkour?
2016.08.05 12:37:33 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: How others could become leaders etc
2016.08.05 12:37:52 Star Warrior Protocut: Loud nigra rainbow ride magic missile bees
2016.08.05 12:37:57 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: bEEEEEES
2016.08.05 12:38:00 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: See thats the issue im running into
2016.08.05 12:38:16 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: what, bees?
2016.08.05 12:38:18 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Like should the arenas themselves be mechanically different
2016.08.05 12:38:23 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Or just aesthetically
2016.08.05 12:38:35 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: uh is this only for combat or
2016.08.05 12:38:38 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: With the lead-up to the arena in the gym itself can be anything tbh

2016.08.05 13:11:39 Grand Master Big_Chungy: it would be cool in theory but annoying in practice
2016.08.05 13:11:47 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: a death bed?
2016.08.05 13:11:49 Grand Master Big_Chungy: if we had regional marty marts stock the same general stuff
2016.08.05 13:11:53 Grand Master Big_Chungy: but unique things to each region
2016.08.05 13:12:06 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: you build a 'region' section to the mart
2016.08.05 13:12:12 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and just stock that on a case by case basis
2016.08.05 13:12:16 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: unless you want to
2016.08.05 13:12:18 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: design a new marty mart
2016.08.05 13:12:19 Grand Master Big_Chungy: but if they're just joke items and not actual things you buy
2016.08.05 13:12:19 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: for each
2016.08.05 13:12:22 Grand Master Big_Chungy: like quadcopter assembly kit
2016.08.05 13:12:29 Grand Master Big_Chungy: or earthquake safety bed
2016.08.05 13:12:29 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh
2016.08.05 13:12:29 Goddess of Light ~Marty: lol
2016.08.05 13:12:31 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I see
2016.08.05 13:12:43 Goddess of Light ~Marty: i was trying to figure out yesterday some things with structure blocks
2016.08.05 13:12:43 Grand Master Big_Chungy: that can fill out the half empty basement
2016.08.05 13:12:52 Goddess of Light ~Marty: to see if we could use that for age of empires
2016.08.05 13:13:01 Grand Master Big_Chungy: structure blocks seem to be the same as schematics
2016.08.05 13:13:02 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh right, structure blocks
2016.08.05 13:13:06 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: they basically are
2016.08.05 13:13:10 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: except you don't need
2016.08.05 13:13:12 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: WE
2016.08.05 13:13:27 Goddess of Light ~Marty: except so far as I can tell it doesn't really do anything WE can't
2016.08.05 13:13:38 Grand Master Big_Chungy: it would play nicer with command blocks
2016.08.05 13:13:40 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: the one thing it can do
2016.08.05 13:13:48 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: is that when saving structures
2016.08.05 13:13:57 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: you can fill air blocks with something else I forget what
2016.08.05 13:14:00 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: but there's a specific block
2016.08.05 13:14:02 Goddess of Light ~Marty: structure void
2016.08.05 13:14:04 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: yeah
2016.08.05 13:14:14 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: if you save a structure block build with structure voids
2016.08.05 13:14:16 Grand Master Big_Chungy: yeah, instead of having air in the schematic it's just nothing
2016.08.05 13:14:18 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: it won't replace blocks with air
2016.08.05 13:14:36 Goddess of Light ~Marty: hey
2016.08.05 13:14:39 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: so as to fit into the area rather than leave a weird square of air around it
2016.08.05 13:14:41 Goddess of Light ~Marty: has anyone built anything notable in the end world
2016.08.05 13:14:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: not yet
2016.08.05 13:14:48 Goddess of Light ~Marty: okay
2016.08.05 13:14:49 Grand Master Big_Chungy: probably crackle
2016.08.05 13:14:56 Goddess of Light ~Marty: I want to see if I can replace it
2016.08.05 13:14:57 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: why?
2016.08.05 13:14:58 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: oh

2016.08.05 13:15:23 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that'd cause people
2016.08.05 13:15:30 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: to just build ugly 1-block bridges
2016.08.05 13:15:31 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: everywhere
2016.08.05 13:15:32 Grand Master Big_Chungy: to eat the hell a lot

2016.08.05 14:12:57 Star Warrior Protocut: Maybe have the stairs be sandstone near the bottom and turn into purpur as they go up
2016.08.05 14:12:58 Goddess of Light ~Marty: some days
2016.08.05 14:13:01 Goddess of Light ~Marty: you go through the rain
2016.08.05 14:13:15 Goddess of Light ~Marty: some days
2016.08.05 14:13:16 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I'm kinda iffy about using the purpur as the stairs
2016.08.05 14:13:19 Goddess of Light ~Marty: you feed on a tree frog
2016.08.05 14:13:23 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: cuz the border of the platform itself is purpur
2016.08.05 14:13:27 Star Warrior Protocut: Yeah, true
2016.08.05 14:13:28 Super Dragon Sp0t_: yea purpur wouldn't look good
2016.08.05 14:13:30 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I was gonna put purpur sides on the stairs
2016.08.05 14:13:37 Super Dragon Sp0t_: i thik maybe just make a subtle natural staircase up
2016.08.05 14:13:45 Super Dragon Sp0t_: like spiraling up the tower
2016.08.05 14:13:46 Star Warrior Protocut: We'll see if we can spruce it up once it's finished
2016.08.05 14:13:58 Star Warrior Protocut: Spot didn't we learn our lesson on spiral stairs
2016.08.05 14:14:03 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I

2016.08.05 14:14:25 Star Warrior Protocut: And I like it going straight out more
2016.08.05 14:14:47 Super Dragon Sp0t_: nyoo
2016.08.05 14:14:52 PSI Kid ~Whirlpool: wowo
2016.08.05 14:15:06 Goddess of Light ~Marty: you know
2016.08.05 14:15:23 Goddess of Light ~Marty: this tower
2016.08.05 14:15:28 Goddess of Light ~Marty: should be chozo themed
2016.08.05 14:15:40 Star Warrior Protocut: It's a bit late in the design process for that
2016.08.05 14:15:44 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I mean
2016.08.05 14:15:49 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: toss some refs or something
2016.08.05 14:15:51 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and I can probably modify it
2016.08.05 14:15:53 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: kind of
2016.08.05 14:15:58 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: that or I'll just build a whole new tower
2016.08.05 14:16:06 Star Warrior Protocut: Put in some bird person heiroglyphics
2016.08.05 14:16:07 Goddess of Light ~Marty: i think it's okay
2016.08.05 14:16:09 Goddess of Light ~Marty: it's like phazon
2016.08.05 14:16:27 Star Warrior Protocut: This is like those phazon meteors kind of
2016.08.05 14:16:37 Star Warrior Protocut: But with obsidian
2016.08.05 14:16:39 Star Warrior Protocut: And stairs
2016.08.05 14:16:40 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: see the problem here is that most of my background is in mythology and eldritch
2016.08.05 14:16:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: and not so much in nintendo
2016.08.05 14:16:53 Goddess of Light ~Marty: you should read the metroid wikia
2016.08.05 14:16:57 Star Warrior Protocut: Well Phazon is basically evil juice
2016.08.05 14:16:58 Goddess of Light ~Marty: it's actually kinda interesting
2016.08.05 14:17:12 Goddess of Light ~Marty: metroid's all about mythology and eldritch horror
2016.08.05 14:17:17 Star Warrior Protocut: Just skip Other M. Most of it's dumb
2016.08.05 14:17:21 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: lol
2016.08.05 14:17:24 Goddess of Light ~Marty: it also adds nothing to the lore
2016.08.05 14:17:24 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: so I've heard
2016.08.05 14:17:26 Star Warrior Protocut: Aside from the Ridley life cycle
2016.08.05 14:17:32 Goddess of Light ~Marty: and how adam died
2016.08.05 14:17:50 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: I thought other M was ok
2016.08.05 14:17:51 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: all I really knew from playing a bit of fusion
2016.08.05 14:17:52 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: as a game
2016.08.05 14:18:00 Goddess of Light ~Marty: you should read the Zero Mission manga
2016.08.05 14:18:01 Star Warrior Protocut: It had flaws
2016.08.05 14:18:03 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I figured adam had been a real person at some point
2016.08.05 14:18:14 Goddess of Light ~Marty: i'll send you a link to the zero mission manga
2016.08.05 14:18:15 Star Warrior Protocut: Like only being able to shoot missiles in first person
2016.08.05 14:18:17 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: mmk
2016.08.05 14:18:22 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: yeah
2016.08.05 14:18:25 Goddess of Light ~Marty: metroid is pretty hardcore
2016.08.05 14:18:30 Star Warrior Protocut: And the hidden object games
2016.08.05 14:18:31 Super Dragon Sp0t_: http://mortyonline.tumblr.com/post/148508995163/jackster3000-snorloaf
2016.08.05 14:18:34 Super Dragon Sp0t_: look how soft
2016.08.05 14:18:41 Star Warrior Protocut: And the fact that the final boss is a hidden object game
2016.08.05 14:18:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: what
2016.08.05 14:19:09 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: also brb real quick
2016.08.05 14:19:15 Star Warrior Protocut: But really the biggest flaw with Other M was giving Samus a voice.
2016.08.05 14:19:21 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Yeah
2016.08.05 14:19:31 Star Warrior Protocut: And the heavy handed symbolism
2016.08.05 14:19:34 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: The story was really flawed imo
2016.08.05 14:19:37 Super Dragon Sp0t_: and THE BABY
2016.08.05 14:19:38 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: I enjoyed the game
2016.08.05 14:19:40 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: THE BABY
2016.08.05 14:20:02 Pocket Monster ~Phoenix: Does a cut exist of all the time she says the baby
2016.08.05 14:20:06 Super Dragon Sp0t_: probably
2016.08.05 14:20:14 Super Dragon Sp0t_: well
2016.08.05 14:20:15 Super Dragon Sp0t_: tbh
2016.08.05 14:20:18 Super Dragon Sp0t_: as a Womyn
2016.08.05 14:20:19 PSI Kid ~Whirlpool: haha idk how to terraform
2016.08.05 14:20:25 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: what
2016.08.05 14:20:34 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: also here's a thought
2016.08.05 14:20:34 Super Dragon Sp0t_: i would be much more upset about a cute fat baby metroid being in danger than a human
2016.08.05 14:20:37 Super Dragon Sp0t_: meat nugget
2016.08.05 14:20:38 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: what if
2016.08.05 14:20:46 Goddess of Light ~Marty: metroids did nothing wrong
2016.08.05 14:20:51 Goddess of Light ~Marty: seriously they're like samus's family
2016.08.05 14:20:56 Goddess of Light ~Marty: and she killed them all
2016.08.05 14:21:05 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: she absorbs them in fusion
2016.08.05 14:21:06 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: literally
2016.08.05 14:21:08 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: absorbs them
2016.08.05 14:21:26 Goddess of Light ~Marty: she becomes one with her metroid DNA
2016.08.05 14:21:44 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: c o n s u m e
2016.08.05 14:21:59 Goddess of Light ~Marty: in the end it's all ridley's fault anyway
2016.08.05 14:22:09 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: also what if bad guys have stuff like this to teleport between their evil bases in space and people
2016.08.05 14:22:11 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: recapture them
2016.08.05 14:22:52 Star Warrior Protocut: Well then this one should probably have a more "recaptured" look to it.
2016.08.05 14:23:13 Star Warrior Protocut: Like with some pieces replaced with iron or dicks drawn on it
2016.08.05 14:23:23 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I was gonna put up like
2016.08.05 14:23:27 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: a research facility around it
2016.08.05 14:23:31 Star Warrior Protocut: That works too
2016.08.05 14:23:45 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: but I mean that's only if we wanna do that idea
2016.08.05 14:23:50 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: otherwise I'm just gonna go get started on the city
2016.08.05 14:24:04 Star Warrior Protocut: I think getting started on the city is a little higher priority right now
2016.08.05 14:24:16 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I mean I clearly have no idea how to design and build it right now so
2016.08.05 14:24:31 Super Dragon Sp0t_: holy sheeps ditzy

2016.08.05 14:46:26 Star Warrior Protocut: A city you know, or could imagine
2016.08.05 14:46:36 Star Warrior Protocut: A city in pain, a city in need of a hero
2016.08.05 14:46:42 Star Warrior Protocut: That hero is SKELETON MAN
2016.08.05 14:46:52 Goddess of Light ~Marty: that's why i was going for republic "town" rather than republic "city"
2016.08.05 14:46:59 Goddess of Light ~Marty: there will definitely be missile silos there tho

2016.08.05 14:48:25 Goddess of Light ~Marty: although i dunno
2016.08.05 14:48:43 Goddess of Light ~Marty: in my mind republic city looks like the period between 1950's - early 1990's

2016.08.05 14:56:33 Star Warrior Protocut: We could build in the middle of nowhere
2016.08.05 14:56:49 Star Warrior Protocut: Or we could build off the side of the island into nowhere
2016.08.05 14:57:19 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: should the warp pad here
2016.08.05 14:57:20 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: be the same

2016.08.05 14:57:36 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: I mean
2016.08.05 14:57:38 Varia Suit ~DJ_Ditz3: just the pad part

2016.08.06 10:36:14 Super Dragon Sp0t_: oh it's fine
2016.08.06 10:36:16 Grand Master Big_Chungy: and it's one downside of the portal being transparent
2016.08.06 10:36:25 Super Dragon Sp0t_: on the more visible side we can put a bush over it

2016.08.06 10:37:55 Super Dragon Sp0t_: oh yeah that's the clovertown warp
2016.08.06 10:38:14 Super Dragon Sp0t_: there's a warp to here called momshouse
2016.08.06 10:38:17 Super Dragon Sp0t_: that's where newfoals should spawn
2016.08.06 10:38:22 Super Dragon Sp0t_: from battlefield
2016.08.06 10:38:40 Grand Master Big_Chungy: so they spawn on battlefield
2016.08.06 10:38:47 Grand Master Big_Chungy: we trust them to avoid two other warps
2016.08.06 10:38:49 Grand Master Big_Chungy: and come here
2016.08.06 10:38:59 Super Dragon Sp0t_: the other two warps shouldn't be active as of now
2016.08.06 10:39:13 Super Dragon Sp0t_: just knock out the glass
2016.08.06 10:42:00 Grand Master Big_Chungy: the momshouse warp doesn't even put you upstairs

2016.08.06 10:44:28 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i don't feel welcomed to clover town ever since the friendly entrance arch got removed :(
2016.08.06 10:45:02 Grand Master Big_Chungy: oh i see where it was moved to
2016.08.06 10:45:27 Grand Master Big_Chungy: nightcore kind of demands the player's attention at that point
2016.08.06 10:45:48 Grand Master Big_Chungy: and the sign is too high to read
2016.08.06 10:45:51 Super Dragon Sp0t_: oh dang
2016.08.06 10:45:55 Super Dragon Sp0t_: hmm
2016.08.06 10:46:42 Super Dragon Sp0t_: here maybe?
2016.08.06 10:46:52 Grand Master Big_Chungy: what was wrong with the initial spot
2016.08.06 10:46:56 Super Dragon Sp0t_: it was like
2016.08.06 10:46:58 Super Dragon Sp0t_: at a weird angle
2016.08.06 10:47:14 Grand Master Big_Chungy: you mean where the player is approaching at a gentle curve
2016.08.06 10:47:24 Super Dragon Sp0t_: yea i guess ur right
2016.08.06 10:47:39 Grand Master Big_Chungy: and has left the horrors of nightcore behind

2016.08.06 10:49:48 Super Dragon Sp0t_: it's still too high to read clearly
2016.08.06 10:49:58 Grand Master Big_Chungy: i guess i'll do command block shenanigans

2016.08.06 10:52:55 Grand Master Big_Chungy: this is alright but the hanging fence kinda makes it look weird
2016.08.06 10:53:03 Grand Master Big_Chungy: the command block will replace any need for a friendly sign
2016.08.06 10:53:03 Super Dragon Sp0t_: eh
2016.08.06 10:53:06 Grand Master Big_Chungy: if this works
2016.08.06 10:53:21 Super Dragon Sp0t_: technology is all we need
